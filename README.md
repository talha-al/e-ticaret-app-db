# e-ticaret-db (For Json Server)

In this project, json server is used. For this reason, these steps should be followed before running Angular;
1. Install the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) application,
2. `npm install -g json-server`,
3. In CMD and run the following code: `json-server --watch db.json`

  Now that our server is up, we can run angular.
  Up the angular with `ng serve` or `npm run start` command.
